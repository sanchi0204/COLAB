The idea is to make an android application where multiple users can shop together and get shared experience just like traditional shopping.
Customers miss shopping with their friends and family.

Customized Product Catalogue:
  Personalized Customer product feed based on:
	Past shop and search history
	Recommendations and Suggestions from family/friends
	Items from family/friends Wishlist or cart

Every product in feed offers a 3D view to know about it in – and – out.
Virtual try-on of clothes/ accessories to pick the best
Receive suggestions of complementing products to add to the look; similar as in a physical store with a virtual salesperson
Share virtual outfit look with family/friends to seek advice
